CIS4930: Introduction to Machine Learning Final Project - Analysis in characteristics for diabetes detection

# Group Members: 
- David Visbal Gomez
- Joshua Delamater
- Jesus Lopez
- Christian Rodriguez
- Vance Boudreau

# Dataset: 
We intend to use a dataset sourced from Kaggle about diabetes prediction. It features 9
different columns of information including gender, age, whether the patient has hypertension,
whether the patient has heart disease, smoking history, body mass index (BMI), Hemoglobin A1c
levels, blood glucose levels, and finally whether the patient has diabetes. This dataset features
integer data, decimal data, and string data. This dataset is crucial to our project because the
dataset will provide critical information for determining whether someone has diabetes.

Initial Plan:
1. We plan to find the underlying factors that have a heavy correlation to diabetes.
2. We plan to use a combination of a linear regression model for the numerical data and a
classification tree for the string data.
3. We will distribute the workload among the members of the group, and we will clean the
data and scale the data so that the model can converge quicker.
